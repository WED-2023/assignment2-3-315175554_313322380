# Recipe Management - Server

This project is the backend part of Recipe Explorer, responsible for handling user management, processing data, and facilitating communication with external APIs. The server is built using Node.js and Express.js to ensure a scalable and efficient backend for the application.

## Key Features

- **API Gateway**: Serves as a mediator between the client and external APIs (e.g., Spoonacular API), ensuring smooth data flow and handling all requests and responses.
- **User Management**: Supports user registration, login, and session management using secure tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- **Data Handling**: Processes, filters, and sorts recipe data based on user preferences and custom inputs.
- **Database Connectivity**: Utilizes MySQL to store user information, manage favorite recipes, and handle user-created recipes, ensuring persistence and data integrity.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for executing server-side code.
- **Express.js**: Framework used for building RESTful APIs and managing server routes.
- **MySQL**: Relational database used to store and manage user-related data, including favorite recipes and custom recipes.
- **Axios**: Used to make HTTP requests to the Spoonacular API for fetching recipe data.

## Development Highlights

- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with a modular structure, allowing for easy scalability and future feature additions.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures the server provides detailed and useful feedback to the client while maintaining stability.
- **Security Best Practices**: Secure authentication via JWT tokens and input validation to safeguard against common security threats.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated logging mechanisms to monitor API usage, errors, and user actions, making debugging and performance optimization easier.

## Unique Aspects

- **Centralized API Management**: Acts as a unified gateway for all client-server communication, streamlining requests to external APIs.
- **Personal Recipe Management**: Allows users to save their own recipes, manage favorites, and retrieve personal data from the database.
- **Session and Token Management**: Handles user sessions securely with JWT, ensuring safe and authenticated API calls.

This server component ensures that the Recipe Explorer app runs efficiently and securely, offering a seamless experience for users while handling complex data management in the background.
